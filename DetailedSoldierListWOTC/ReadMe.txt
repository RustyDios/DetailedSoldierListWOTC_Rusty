-bg- created an XCOM 2 Mod Project --- which I then cloned!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128263618 Detailed Soldier List <Original Mod>

DOES NOT WORK WITH RPGO ( INTEGRATES THE LIST)

contains some fixes from Kdm2k6 copied from LWotC github
contains some updates for CHL integration
contains a slight re-ordering of icons for better display
contains some newer icons and fixes the comint one 
has options for LW's officer class icon 

MANY Thanks to -bg- / bountygiver for the the original DSL and Pavonis/LWStudios
Thanks obviously to the discord, in particular Iridar, Xymanek and LWOTCPeter for help getting LW officer icons working
